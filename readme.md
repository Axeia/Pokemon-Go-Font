# Pokémon Go Font

Whilst working on my site located at eggfriends.me I found myself needing various Pokémon Go related icons and decided to make my own icon font.

## Getting Started

Just download the whole thing and you can open the .sfd file with [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/)


## Tools used

* [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) - The font creation tool (for the .sfd file)
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - Vector Graphics editor (for the .svg files)
* [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) - When FontForge complains about .svg files being too complex, try feeding them through this site
* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - For getting colour information out of the .png files
* [ColorZilla gradient editor](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/]) - For graphically creating CSS gradients
